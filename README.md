# RoxMux

RoxMux is a Collection of Multiplexer Controllers for some commonly used multiplexer chips.

RoxMux includes support for:

- [74HC165](docs/74HC165.md)
- [74HC595](docs/74HC595.md)
- [74HC4067](docs/74HC4067.md)
- [74HC4051](docs/74HC4067.md)
- [MCP23017](docs/MCP23017.md) *(supported as of version 1.1.4)*
- [MCP23018](docs/MCP23017.md) *(supported as of version 1.1.4)*

In Addition as of Version 1.1.3 RoxMux has a class to read buttons called RoxButton. This class
allows you to read a button connected directly to a pin or a multiplexer.
RoxMux also allows you to read/debounce and detect a Press, Release and if the button
was held!

Version 1.1.4 adds support for encoders and pots reading.

- [RoxButton](docs/RoxButton.md) *(supported as of version 1.1.3)*
- [RoxEncoder](docs/RoxEncoder.md) *(supported as of version 1.1.4)*
- [RoxPot](docs/RoxPot.md) *(supported as of version 1.1.4)*

See examples for code information.

RoxMux containes multiple libraries in one, just include `<RoxMux.h>` to get started. All the libraries are templated to reduce RAM usage.

No matter which mux or utility you will be using, you always have to include `#include <RoxMux.h>` this file will include all the RoxMux controllers.

## Examples

### 74HC595
This is a simple example to write to a 74HC595, change `MUX_TOTAL` to the number of chainged 74HC595s you have wired.

```c++
#include <RoxMux.h>

// MUX_TOTAL is the number of 74HC595s that you have chained together
// if you have more than 1 then change it to that number.
#define MUX_TOTAL 1
// blinking was added to version 1.1.5 of RoxMux
// BLINK_RATE determines the speed at which any led set to BLINK will turn on/off
// you have to use .blinkPin(pinNumber, true/false) to turn blinking on/off
// per pin, also an led will only blink if it's turned on
#define BLINK_RATE 50

Rox74HC595 <MUX_TOTAL, BLINK_RATE> mux;

// pins for 74HC595
#define PIN_DATA    11 // pin 14 on 74HC595 (DATA)
#define PIN_LATCH   9  // pin 12 on 74HC595 (LATCH)
#define PIN_CLK     8  // pin 11 on 74HC595 (CLK)

// PIN_PWM MUST BE A PWM CAPABLE PIN
// set it's value to -1 if you do not wish to control the brightness
// if you don't need to control the brightness you must wire
// pin 13 on the 74HC595 to ground.
#define PIN_PWM     10  // pin 13 on 74HC595

// Wire pin 10 to VCC

unsigned long prevTime = 0;
uint8_t counter = 0;
const uint16_t totalPins = 8 * MUX_TOTAL;

// if you use a PWM pin you can set the brightness for all LEDs.
uint8_t brightness = 255;

void setup(){
  mux.begin(PIN_DATA, PIN_LATCH, PIN_CLK, PIN_PWM);
  prevTime = millis();

  // set the brightness, only works if you set and wired a PWM pin
  // 0 will turn them off, 255 will do a digitalWrite HIGH
  mux.setBrightness(brightness);

  // as of version 1.1.5 you can blink independent leds, you must set
  // the blink state via .blinkPin(pinNumber, true/false)
  // after that anytime you turn the led on, the led will blink instead of
  // just staying on.

  // You can set the blink rate as part of the instance declaration

  // set every other led to blink instead of staying on
  mux.blinkPin(0, true);
  mux.blinkPin(2, true);
  mux.blinkPin(4, true);
  mux.blinkPin(6, true);

}

void loop(){
  // the update() method will only write to the 74HC595 whenever a pin value
  // has changed from it's buffer.
  mux.update();

  // turn each led on then off every second
  if((millis()-prevTime) > 1000){
    // change the brightness every
    mux.allOff();
    mux.writePin(counter, HIGH);
    counter++;
    if(counter >= totalPins){
      counter = 0;
    }
    prevTime = millis();
  }
}
```

### 74HC165
This is a simple example to read from a 74HC165, change `MUX_TOTAL` to the number of chainged 74HC165s you have wired.

```c++
#include <RoxMux.h>

// MUX_TOTAL is the number of 74HC165s that you have chained together
// if you have more than 1 then change it to that number.
#define MUX_TOTAL 1
Rox74HC165 <MUX_TOTAL> mux;

#define PIN_DATA  23 // pin 9 on 74HC165 (DATA)
#define PIN_LOAD  22 // pin 1 on 74HC165 (LOAD)
#define PIN_CLK   21 // pin 2 on 74HC165 (CLK))

// keep track of the previous state of the pins
// each element of the array holds the state of 8 pins, 1 per bit
uint8_t pinStates[MUX_TOTAL];

void setup(){
  Serial.begin(115200);
  mux.begin(PIN_DATA, PIN_LOAD, PIN_CLK);
}

void loop(){
  // read all the mux chips at once, always call it in the loop()
  mux.update();

  for(uint8_t i=0;i<MUX_TOTAL;i++){
    // read all pins from the mux specified by "i"
    uint8_t data = mux.read(i);
    // to read a single pin from a specific mux you would do:
    // bool data = mux.read(muxIndex, muxPin);
    // where muxIndex is the mux you are reading from
    // and muxPin is the pin of that mux you want to read


    // compare the mux states to the last saved states
    if(data != pinStates[i]){
      // if they change update the last states and print their values
      pinStates[i] = data;
      printStates(i);
    }
  }
}

  // being the mux
  mux.begin(PIN_CH0, PIN_CH1, PIN_CH2, PIN_CH3);

  // the first argument is the index of the mux, second is the pin number
  mux.setSignalPin(0, PIN_SIG);
}

void loop(){
  // read the mux
  // this method should always be in your loop() function
  // the update method has an option parameter which is the number of millis
  // between each pin read, if you don't pass an argument it will read them
  // every 1 millisecond
  mux.update();
  // read each pin
  for(uint8_t i=0,n=MUX_TOTAL*16;i<n;i++){
    // since the Rox74HC4067 doesn't smooth the values it just reads them raw
    // we'll only read one pin on this example
